## One year of life in Norway

I wrote this piece in January 2020, and wasn't sure if I should post it, but today is the day. For those who don't know me, I moved to Norway in January 2019. This post isn't about the differences between Norway and Portugal, but more focused on the type of work I'm doing right know. How I jumped from a developer that mostly does enterprise websites to a developer focused on one big web app and one big mobile app.

## Company differences

There aren't so many differences to begin with, both my previous and my current company are small companies, with a small team, with Intutor (current company) having a slightly bigger team. I would say the difference is this small team works with big projects, one of them holds 70% marketshare, and here I'm more focused on the project I'm working on. 

At Velcro(previous company) every week I had a different website to do, different client, different everything and after a while I started to hate that. I felt like my work was not important at all, because after a week everyone would forget about that website, unless some bug creeped out.

## Big projects

I see myself as backend developer and when my boss said that they don't have designers and I didn't need to focus too much time on styling I was pretty happy. Don't get me wrong I like pretty UI's and I always try to make everything beautiful, but following someone else's design is not for me, specially when they don't have a clue about what is possible and what isn't.

I was pretty happy when I got picked to convert our biggest project to a mobile app, even thought I don't enjoy frontend as much as backend I felt valued.

## Technologies

Previously I was using CodeIgniter (a really old PHP framework) and HTML with SASS to build websites, with a CMS that I tuned a lot. It really worked great after I tweaked it to the maximum, it made me do websites really fast.

Now I'm using Symfony framework for a legal documents archive project, it feels great to use a big boys framework. And for mobile applications I'm using React Native with Expo. We were thinking about Flutter for mobile development but I think it's not mature enough.

## Would I move back?

Well sometimes this job has a lot more responsibility, but the freedom I have here is way better than in other job I had before. I can suggest other technologies and I made the team use GitHub Issues for issues report and also task management which works great for small teams and I'm absolutely loving it. I would not go back to my previous job but I really appreciate all the baggage it gave me.
